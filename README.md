## Dataset

shape: (9551, 21)
- columns: 'Restaurant ID', 'Restaurant Name', 'Country Code', 'City', 'Address', 'Cuisines', 'Has Table booking',
       'Has Online delivery', 'Is delivering now','Price range', 'Aggregate rating', 'Rating color', 'Rating text',etc.,
       
## Project Workflow:

### Data Extraction

Extracted data from data source.
Cleaned and standardized raw data for further analysis.

### Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values, data type conversions, and outlier detection.
Normalized or scaled features as necessary to ensure compatibility with models.

### Descriptive Analysis

Conducted basic statistical analysis to understand data distributions.
Computed key metrics and explored relationships between variables.

### Geospatial Analysis

Used geospatial data (e.g., latitude and longitude) to conduct analysis and visualize geographic trends.
Tools used-folium.

### Predictive Modeling
steps:
1.Encoding
2.Train Test split
3.Feature scaling
4.Feature selection

Built and evaluated multiple predictive models to make data-driven forecasts.
Selected the model with the highest performance based on RÂ², accuracy, or other relevant metrics.

### Data Visualization

Created visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to present insights and model results.
Visualized important trends, distributions, and model predictions.

## Results

This model is effective in predicting the aggregate rate based on the selected features, with high accuracy and valuable insights into feature importance.
